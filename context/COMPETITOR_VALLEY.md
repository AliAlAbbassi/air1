## Core Philosophy: "Awareness-Led Outbound"

Valley's key differentiator is signal-based outreach - reaching out to prospects already showing intent rather than cold spray-and-pray.

**The insight:** 98% of website visitors leave without a trace. These are people actively researching solutions. Valley identifies them and reaches out while intent is fresh (24-48 hours).

## Workflow (5 Steps)

1. **Find high-intent leads** - Identifies prospects showing buyer signals (LinkedIn activity, website visits, firmographic fit). Auto-enriches contact details.

2. **Research them** - Automates context gathering on pain points, interests, recent company news.

3. **Score them** - Auto-score and qualify based on ICP and intent model (demographic, behavioral, engagement criteria).

4. **Craft messages in your voice** - AI tailors outreach reflecting your tone while referencing lead's specific context.

5. **Send at scale** - Automate messaging sequences, manage replies, draft responses for human review.
